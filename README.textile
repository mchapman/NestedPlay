This project demonstrates the extentions to the Ryan Bates & Andrea Singh's nested_forms gem at
https://github.com/mchapman/nested_form which allows a 'pop-up' form to be used for creating a
nested record.  A drill down to edit the record could perhaps be implemented.

Hand crafted javascript is used to display the nested record in whatever format is required.

New records are added in a simple 'pop-up' form.
